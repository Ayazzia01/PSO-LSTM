# PSO LSTM

PSO LSTM is an optimizer for Keras neural network models that implements particle swarm optimization (PSO) for training as an alternative to backpropation algorithms.
We can use LSTM network easily with PSO optimization technique.

## Set up environment
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
